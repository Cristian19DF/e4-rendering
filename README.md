e4-rendering
============
e4-rendering is a proof of concept for providing new rendering engines
for the Eclipse 4 Application platform. I provide engines for
* JavaFX 2.1
* Swing
* SWT (alternative renderer to prove that the generic concepts are working with SWT)

Setup
-----
* Install JavaFX (SDK or Runtime) for your platform
* Install e(fx)clipse for your platform, see efxclipse.org
* Open the Eclipse SDK and set the JavaFX SDK location in the prefences
* Restart Eclipse
* Import all projects from this git repo
* Use the predefined run configurations to launch the JavaFX, Swing and SWT demos
